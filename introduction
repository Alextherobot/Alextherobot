- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alextherobot
- ðŸ‘€ I'm an architecture student passionate about the intersection of design and technology. I believe that blending innovative technology with thoughtful design principles can shape the built environment in transformative ways.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm exploring various architectural design methodologies, leveraging digital tools and cutting-edge software. I'm particularly interested in incorporating data-driven design approaches to create efficient and user-centric spaces. My goal is to push the boundaries of architectural practice and contribute to sustainable and inclusive built environments.
- ðŸ”­ On GitHub, you'll find me working on projects that bridge architecture and technology. I enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals to explore new design paradigms, improve existing workflows, and contribute to open-source architectural initiatives.
- ðŸ’» Basically, I'll starting on this platform by progressing certain basic projects- photography, videography, idea research, project documentation, etc.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me if you share similar interests or have exciting ideas for collaboration. Let's connect and shape the future of architecture together!
